    "In this exercise you will see an application of the correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you measure the transverse acceleration (using a \"traditional\" seismometer) and the rotation rate (using for example a ring laser) at the same location, the waveforms should be the same. This only holds if the horizontal components (N, E) of the seismometer record are oriented to point towards the earthquake source location: towards \"radial\" (R, pointing to source) and \"transverse\" (T, perpendicular to the great circle path connecting source and receiver). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know where the source was, you can exploit this property by using the correlation coefficient. In this exercise, a seismogram is cut into smaller time windows. For each time window, the two horizontal components (N, E) are oriented towards different backazimuth angles from 0-360, giving us R, T components for each angle. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each angle between 0-360, the waveform of the transverse (T) component is compared to the waveform for rotation. If the waveforms match, you know you have the correct angle and are pointing towards the source. \n",

    "2a) Can you explain why the correlation coeffcient is used for this?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Cell 2a, there is the option to download signals for four different events. Choose one of events 1-3 (uncomment the corresponding 't1' and 't2') and run cell 2a. The processing described above is performed in cell 2b, and cell 2c plots the results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2b) In the second plot, red colors indicate good positive correlation (up to 1), grey stands for negative correlation (down to -1). Can you say towards which backazimuth the earthquake occurred? Why are the grey colors always separated by 180 degrees from the red colors? \n",
