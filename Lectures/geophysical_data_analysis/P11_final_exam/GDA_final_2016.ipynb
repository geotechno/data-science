    "In this exercise you will work on broadband data from the Mw8.2 Chile earthquake from 1st of April 2014 at 23:46:47 UTC recorded at the black forest station in SW Germany (BFO). The goal of this exercise is to show your understanding of the principal basics in signal processing. Answer the following questions and perform the necessary steps in the corresponding code cells.\n",

    "a) In cell 1a you fetch the waveforms via the FDSN client of IRIS and remove the instrument characteristic of the data (no further coding necessary here). Explain what \"removing the instrument response\" means and why it is necessary. Which mathematical method do you connect with this step? What is to consider during instrument response removal? A hint is given by the options used for removing the instrument response. Comment on all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Now that you have downloaded the data and removed the instrument response, which further steps do you need to perform for pre-processing? Assume that for your scientific task the highest frequency you want to analyse is 5Hz. Describe the general pre-processing chain and point out the possible pitfalls and how to avoid them. Among others, some steps are high-pass filtering and demean as well as detrend the trace. Why do you do so?\n",

    "Using [signal.convolve](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.convolve.html) convolve the two signals in Cell 3a. Set the mode='same'. Explain the meaning of the mode parameter. <br>\n",

    "b) In cell 3b, replace one of signals with a new signal that has a different shape. Convolve the signals and plot them again. Are convolutions commutative? \n",

    "c) In cell 3c, convolve the signals win and sig in the reverse order, continuing to use mode='same'. Replot. <br>\n",
    "Are the results the same or different from cell 2a? Explain this result. Explain any inconsistencies.\n",

    "In Cell 4a theoretical gravity data, modeled for the ringlaser location in Wettzell, are loaded. The data show a superposition of tidal effects due to different celestial bodies. Here is a short overview of the most important ones, sorted according the amplitude of their influence on Earth:\n",
    "+ tides with a period of half a day from sun, moon, Mars, Jupiter, etc. ..., period: 0.5 day \n",
    "+ tides with a period of one day from sun, moon, Mars, Jupiter, etc. ..., period: 1 days\n",

    "+ equinox - sun and moon passing the equator plane, period: 186 days (about every six months)\n",
    "+ Chandler wobble (deviation of Earth's axis of rotation relative to the solid Earth), period: 433 days\n",
    "+ effects due to further planets ....\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "a) In Cell 4b, calculate the spectrum of the data and plot it (as a log-log plot). Try to identify the different tidal effects and name the frequencies of their peak positions. Why is the peak for the Chandler wobble not really visible in the spectrogram? \n",
    "Hint: To calculate the spectrum, you can use the function [periodogram](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.13.0/reference/generated/scipy.signal.periodogram.html) of the scipy.signal package.\n",
    "\n",

    "Explain what happens behind the screens when applying a filter to data (in mathematical sense). \n",
    "\n",
    "c) Now, isolate the half day and full day tides separately from each other and from the rest of the data. Which filter do you choose this time and why? Plot the filtered signal for about the first 25 days on top of the filtered data from exercise 1b.  \n",
    "How can a filter be defined, in terms of responses? There are mainly three different keywords. Describe them. Why do we need three instead of only one definition?\n"
